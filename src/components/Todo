To-Do App Algorithm with useState
Initialize State:

Create a state variable todos to hold the list of tasks (array).

Create a state variable todo to hold the current input text (string).

Add Task:

When the user types in the input box, update todo state with the current input value.

When the user clicks the "Add" button (or presses Enter):

Check if todo is not empty.

Add the current todo string to the todos array (use spread operator).

Reset the todo state to an empty string.

Display Tasks:

Loop over the todos array using .map().

For each task, render it inside an <li> or any container.

Each task should have a unique key.

Delete Task:

Add a "Delete" button next to each task.

When clicked, remove that task from the todos array.

This can be done by filtering out the task based on its index or unique id.

Update UI:

React automatically re-renders the UI when the state changes (todos or todo).
